# BinanceTrading
To connect to Binance I used the projct https://github.com/binance/binance-connector-dotnet.git.
The project is in developing mode.

This projcet helps you: 
1) - to count and view your income on the Binance for some coin
2) - to view on the same page for some coin graphics for different time stamps
3) - esasy to write your own robot for trading on the Binance
4) - to check your trading robot on historical data for some coin

     Start or how to start
For using this project you need to have Binance credential data: ApiKey, SecretKey.
Create keys.txt and write there: ApiKey;SecretKey.
Find in BinanceIncomeViewer file Settings.settings and find there settings with name PathToFileWithKeys and write there path to file keys.txt.
